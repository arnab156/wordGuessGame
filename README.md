Lets play "GUESS MY FAVORITE CITY"

1. Press the red button to start. There are no timers so no rush!

2. You will notice you will notice some dashes in the blue color box. Each dash ( "-" ) respresents a single letter of my favorite city in the whole world!

3. Depending on the length of the world you will get a certain number of tries. You can see it next to "Guess Remaining" in the tan color box.

4. You will need to press any letter between (a to z). You can also see all the letters you have played. If you play the same letter twice, you will not get another chance. So, take your time. Do not press space bar. 

5. Everytime you press a letter present in the name of the city that you have to guess, the letters will reveal themselves. If there are more than one of the same letter, both will be revealed to you. yay!

6. Keep playing since my favorite cities keep changing based on my mood.
